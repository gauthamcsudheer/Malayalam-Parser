	\subsection{Purpose}
	This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document outlines the specifications for
	developing a Malayalam Parser. The goal is to create an NLP-based system capable of
	accurately parsing and understanding Malayalam text data. This document covers
	functional and non-functional requirements, system scope, and serves as a communication
	tool between stakeholders.
	
	\begin{itemize}[label=-]
		\item The Malayalam Parser system will focus primarily on analyzing and parsing written text in the Malayalam language.
		\item Initially, the system will target general-purpose parsing tasks but can be extended to handle domain-specific or specialized parsing tasks in the future.
		\item The scope includes the development of necessary algorithms, data structures and linguistic resources required for accurate parsing of Malayalam text.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Product Scope}
	The Malayalam Parser is a smart tool that understands written Malayalam text. It breaks
	down sentences to figure out their grammar, structure, and meaning using advanced
	language processing techniques. It helps with tasks like identifying different parts of
	speech, understanding how sentences are put together, and analyzing the overall meaning
	of text.\\
	The Malayalam Parser directly contributes to corporate goals and business strategies by
	enabling:
	
	\begin{itemize}[label=-]
		\item \textbf{Effective Communication:} By accurately parsing Malayalam text, the tool facilitates clear communication with Malayalam-speaking audiences, supporting

	The software interacts with the hardware components of the system through various
	interfaces, each with specific communication protocols. It communicates with the CPU to
	execute algorithms, process data, and manage computational tasks, utilizing the CPU's
	instruction set architecture. The software uses RAM for temporary storage of linguistic
	data, parsing results, and intermediate processing steps, managing memory efficiently for
	complex linguistic analyses. For long-term storage, the software reads and writes data to
	the storage device, employing file systems for dataset management and data integrity.
	Optionally, the software can access external datasets, online resources, or collaboration
	tools through a network interface, using standard networking protocols such as HTTP or
	FTP for data exchange. User interaction and data visualization are facilitated through
	input/output devices such as keyboards, mouse, and monitors, utilizing standard interfaces
